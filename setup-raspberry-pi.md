# Work in Progress! 
# **Guidelines for Raspberry Pi SetUp and Execution**  
*... -> will be replaced with python file names*
**Preliminary Steps:**  
Create a folder on the Raspberry Pi to store python codes.  
Create a conda environment to run the python codes.  

## Step 1: Audio Files
Modify  ... to consider your output file destination and execute on conda environment.  
Execute on conda envrionment using:      
**python ...**

This code records audio of specified duration and stores it in the assigned destination folder after execution.  
*Ignore this step if the Raspberry Pi already has the recorded audio used for analysis  

## Step 2: Transcription and Analysis
Modify ... to consider your output file destination and model specs. 
Execute ... and ... simultaneously on different ternimals.  
Terminal 1: **python ...**  
Terminal 2: **python ...**  
... obtains the transcript using selected ASR model and calculates the WER, GFLOPs and Self CPU time.
... calculates the RAM Usage and CPU temperature to analyze the performance of ...
